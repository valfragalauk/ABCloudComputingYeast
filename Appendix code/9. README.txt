The following describes the execution order of the pipeline used for each section of the paper.

RNA sequencing order

1. Download raw sequencing data (FASTQ files)
2 Quality control of raw reads
3. Prepare the reference genome (one-time only)
4. Align reads and quantify expression with RSEM
5. Differential expression analysis with DESeq2 in R

Genome assembly order

1. Download raw genome sequencing data
2. Quality control of raw reads
3. BY4742 genome assembly (dataset 1)
4. BY4742 genome assembly (dataset 2)
5. SY14 initial de novo genome assembly
6. SY14 genome assembly rerun / recovery
7. BWA indexing of SY14 assembly
8. Read alignment to SY14 assembly (BWA-MEM)
9. Genome polishing with Pilon (round 1)
10. Genome polishing with Pilon (round 2)

3D Structuring order

1. Download HiC files
2. Quality control HiC files
3. Genome Indexing for aligning HiC files
4. Mapping HiC reads to reference genome
5. HiC pairs
