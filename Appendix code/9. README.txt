The following describes the execution order of the pipeline used for each section of the paper.

RNA sequencing order

1. Download raw sequencing data (FASTQ files)
2 Quality control of raw reads
3. Prepare the reference genome (one-time only)
4. Align reads and quantify expression with RSEM
5. Differential expression analysis with DESeq2 in R

3D Structuring order

1. Download HiC files
2. Quality control HiC files
3. Genome Indexing for aligning HiC files
4. Mapping HiC reads to reference genome
5. HiC pairs
